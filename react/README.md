# React Framework

In this repository was developed some samples with react. React is a powerfull javascript lib, despite it is not a framework.

## Samples
(./1-sample-phonebook)[1-sample-phonebook]
(./2-sample-pizzeria)[2-sample-pizzeria]

## PrÃ©-requisites
Node >= 4
npm  >= 3

Obs. nvm could help you to chance Node version. 

## Creating a sample
All samples was created using the project generator 'create-react-app'.
```
https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app
```

To create your own app, you will need 'npm' installed and Node with version 4 or greater. Then, execute the following commands in terminal.

```
npm install -g create-react-app

create-react-app my-app
cd my-app/
npm start
```

This will launch a Node server in port 3000 to access the app.

## Test
Access http://localhost:3000
